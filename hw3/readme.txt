The sound source for this composition is a random recording I found of myself
playing the piano dated October of 2015. I wanted to use one sound source and
see how far one could push the limit of granular synthesis in order to create
new sonic textures.

Structurally, I imagine the piece taking a large arc, beginning and ending with
familiar piano echos (with the addition of a small coda). The middle 
portion develops on the main sonic textures and also becomes more obviously
computer manipulated. 

Choosing to sonify each LiSa to purely output to either the left or the right
channel results in an interesting effect (not merely echo, since the source
for each LiSa is sampling form the same position in the file, but usually for
different lengths). Stacking LiSas with different grain lengths in each
channel lets different properties of the sound source shine through.

The piece mostly maintains its tonal integrity and full-bodied sound, though
different pitch ranges become prominent throughout the development. I
experimented mainly with augmenting the playback rate of the LiSas by factors
of two, however a few other perfect intervals are incorporated throughout the
piece. 

Perhaps the greatest difficulty in working with this piece was attempting to
make sense out of such a large sound file. Determining which parts of the
file could deserve better attention was mainly a trial and error process.
