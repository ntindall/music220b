Assignment 3

component 1:
  generative drum machine (some class)

component 2:
  generative soundscape (integrating algorithms to gnerate/modify the
  strucutres of sounds)
  interactive control (integrating devices such as game controller, wii remote,
  microphone, keyboard, mouse, etc)
  note elements in category 2 should be used to control patterns and structures
  of music, not simply pitch or timbre

See writeup on website..

Check examples for some of the UGens you have not used too much.

Look into chuck standard in reading stuff

smelt

OnePole: Lowpass recursive
Leaky integrator
Envelope tracker

trackpad => deltas => impulses
keys select the resonZ (what pitch to tune resonZ at)

.5::second => dur T;
T - (now % T) => now; //wait until the next period
