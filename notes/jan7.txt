Music as motion over time.

THX Deep Note
  - Setup stage
  - Initial stage (TENSION)
  - Converging stage 
  - Hold stage    (ORDER)

Stop perceiving pitch above 5000Hz
  - If we played "Mary Had a Little Lamb" above 5000Hz, we wouldn't be able to
    perceive the melody.

Design complexity as the sum of simple elements (local independence with global
coordiantion).

Math.srandom(); //seed the random function
Math.random2f(floor, ceiling) => float m;
Math.random2(floor, ceiling) => int n;

All shreds share the same pseudorandom number generator.

/****************/

fun float uniform()
{
    return Math.random2f(0,1);
}

fun float guss()
{
  float sum;
  repeat(12) uniform +=> sum;
  return sum / 12;

}

// patch
Rhodey foo => JCRev r => dac;
//reverb
.1 => r.mix;

while (true)
{
  20 + uniform() * 100 => Std.mtof => foo.freq;
  //note on
  1 => foo.noteOn;
  120::ms => now;
}
