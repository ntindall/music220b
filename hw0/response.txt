Music 220B - Winter 2016

The notion of cellular automaton seems directly related to music and music
composition -- a set of deterministic rules that can lead to chaotic and complex
behavior. This idea, in tandem with the "restricted" set of universes that the
second paper discusses, seems directly parallel to traditional music, where one
set of worlds is explored (through evolution of classical harmonies, etc.). It
seems feasible that computers can do more than is implementable in the real
world, and can bring to life sounds that cannot be created there. I really like
how cellular automaton seem to evolve over time based upon the starting state.
This seems just like music -- where there is a natural progression over time.
The key difference, I think, is that while cellular automaton have deterministic
rules, the "rules" of music seem to change at each step (and identifying or even
beginning to enumerate them may be impossible).
