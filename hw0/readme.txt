To run either program for homework zero (haikus):

For the first haiku, I wanted to have two concurrent processes that ran
complementary of one another. I choice the voice form and experimented with
iterating through its phonemes in different ways, eventually deciding on a
progression evolving from a "wail" to a sort of "whisper" over time. This 
haiku is essentially nondeterminisatic. The main difficulty here was trying to 
fit it all on three lines (there is a whole lot packed in there!).

For the second haiku, I wanted to try to synthesize a very complex sound.
The soundspace is essentially two dimensional for this haiku, with two 
instruments oscillating from full left to full right pan (each the inverse of
the other). This gives the effect of two sound sources moving linearly from
left to right. Each has a slightly different pitch (detuned by one Hz), and 
is pitshifted in a cyclical manner either in a descending or ascending fashion.
The result is very similar to the sound of cars racing by the listener. 
Experimenting with different frequencies and delta values (for the panning) also
leads to interesting effects.
