Notes

For my final project, I have constructed a framework to sonify network
data live. Each packet that is sent or received on my machine is captured
by Wireshark and written to a file. A separate process then reads from the file
(in real time) and sends OSC messges to Chuck, which then sonifies the sound
based upon the packet received. The pitch of the articulation is mapped to one
of the 4 integers in an IPv4 address. The articulation is then fed through a 
comb filter bank, which is dynamically constructed by trace routing to hosts,
building up a "reverberation space" in which sounds from the traffic can
resonate. There is an additional human interaction component, that allows for
more artful manipulation of an otherwise highly stochastic sound. The arrow keys
control both delay of the comb filters and the rate of articulation (delay
between each subsequent note). The sound is presented in an eight channel
soundscape that encompassses the listener with the sheer volume and randomness
of the dataset.

Because the data is so random, it makes reasoning about the behaviour of the
piece somewhat difficult. A big part of the performance is embracing the
uncertainty of what results actions on the computer will produce. Part of the
point is coming to grips with the fact that behind the scenes of high level
abstractions there are deep and highly intricate systems at work.
